# Redux Essentials - TypeScript

This is a TypeScript version of the [Redux Essentials Tutorial](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-essentials-example-app). It tries to follow the original as closely as possible.

## Key differences

### TypeScript

- All JavaScript files are converted to TypeScript
  - `mockServiceWorker.js` is automatically generated by `msw`, and has been left as is
- Extensions have been made into `.ts` and `.tsx`, depending on their use of JSX
- Types have been added to [`src/app-lib/hooks.ts`](src/app-lib/hooks.ts) and [`src/app-lib/store.ts`](src/app-lib/store.ts)
- API response and request types have been added to [`src/types/api.ts`](src/types/api.ts)
- Changes have been made to the code in [`src/api/server.ts`](src/api/server.ts) to satisfy TypeScript compiler
  - Most of the changes involve 404 errors when invalid IDs are passed.

### Tooling

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) is used for building rather than `react-scripts` (Webpack)
  - [`index.html`](index.html) is in a different location for Vite compatibility. See [here](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#index-html-and-project-root) for more details.
  - `index.js` is now `main.tsx`, and `index.css` is now `main.css`. This isn't strictly required but it's a Vite convention.
- Husky will run `Prettier` at every commit
  - If this is undesirable, simply delete the `lint-staged` portion at the bottom of `package.json`.
- ESLint setup has been changed
  - New setup uses plugin recommended settings instead of `react-scripts`.
  - New import rule for using typed Redux hooks

### Libraries

- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) upgraded to v6
  - There are a lot of API changes that are incompatible. See [here](https://blog.logrocket.com/migrating-react-router-v6-complete-guide/) for more details.
- `faker` has been replaced with [`@faker-js/faker`](https://fakerjs.dev/)
  - `faker` appears to be unmaintained, and as for the latest package... [see for yourself](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker/v/6.6.6).
- Unused libraries are uninstalled

### Code changes

- `src/app` has been renamed to `src/app-lib`
  - This is to avoid naming conflicts (e.g. if `src/app/index.ts` were to be added).
- Function component declarations (e.g. `function MyComponent()`) have been changed to arrow function expressions (e.g. `const MyComponent: FC<Props> =`)
  - This facilitates better typing practices, and is more common in modern code.
  - The two are not strictly the same. See [here](https://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/ch_callables.html) for more details.
